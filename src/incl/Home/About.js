          <h4>Data Scientist</h4>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Cecil. I'm a former Chemical Engineer, but now a
            aspiring to become a data scientist. During my last few years of
            engineering school, I started reading about and statistics and
            implementing machine learning algorithms and decided I wanted to
            make machine learning a part of my career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following my graduation, I promptly travelled to the UK, perfecting
            my English skills whilst writing a research paper related to latent
            heat storage in house heating applications. Since my return I have
            been someone who spends most of their time coding and currently
            learning with the Georgia Techâ€™s data analytics program. When I'm
            not working on that, I'm generally working on something related to
            python, react or training aerial straps.
